# Feedback

Some basic and useful functions for modeling feedbacks.

## Functions

|   |   |
|---|---|
|[decay](#decay)|Return the decay of a rate given a time interval.|
|[growth](#growth)|Return the growth of a rate given a time interval.|

## **decay** 

Return the decay of a rate given a time interval. The returned value can be directly multipled to compute the updated value applying the given decay.  
  

### Arguments

- **#1**: A decay rate per time unit. For example, a value of 0.2 means that there will be a decrease of 20% each time step.
- **#2**: A time interval or an Event. In the latter case, this function will use the Event's period as a time interval. The returning value is (1 - #1) ^ #2. For example, if the time interval is equals to one, the returning value will be one minus #1.

### Usage

```
import("sci")

decay(0.5, 1) -- 0.5 (decay of 50% in one time step)
decay(0.1, 1/12) -- 10% per year in one month will be 0.99125 (reducing 0.875% per month)
```

## **growth** 

Return the growth of a rate given a time interval. The returned value can be directly multipled to compute the updated value applying the given growth.  
  

### Arguments

- **#1**: A growth rate per time unit. For example, a value of 0.2 means that there will be 20% of growth each time step.
- **#2**: A time interval or an Event. In the latter case, this function will use the Event's period as a time interval. The returning value is (1 + #1) ^ #2. For example, if the time interval is equals to one, the returning value will be one plus #1.

### Usage

```
import("sci")

growth(0.5, 1) -- 1.5 (growth of 50% in one time step)
growth(0.1, 1/12) -- 10% per year in one month will be 1.00797 (increasing 0.797% per month)
```
